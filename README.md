# CS-385 Codespaces Template

## How to use this template

1. Get the GitHub Education Pack:
    https://education.github.com/pack

    You will then have a GitHub Pro account. So, you can create projects
    (repositories) on GitHub which are private.

2. Click the green button on this page which says "Use this template."

3. Give your repository a name and **make it private**.

4. Once your repository is created, click the green button that contains `< >`.

5. Select "Codespaces" from the dropdown menu.

6. Click "New Codespace."

7. You are now in a Codespace. Open the `lab.c` file in `labs/labExample`. This
   is a C++ file you can edit. Make any changes you want, press
   <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> to save.

8. In the terminal, run `cd labs/labExample` to go to the lab directory in the
   terminal.

9. Run `make` to compile the lab.

10. Run `./lab` to run the lab.

Congratulations! You can now run C++ code on an Ubuntu machine.
